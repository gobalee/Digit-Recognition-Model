# Digit-Recognition-Model
Building a Model which can identify handwritten digits, without the use of Deep Learning libraries.
1. Used mnist dataset from tensorflow keras 
2. Used a basic 'difference' function to build the model.
3. The model gave an accuracy of 90.4% for only 10% of the training dataset used for training.
